\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
In this project, we have looked thoroughly into the literature and legacy work of continual learning and then we choose two representative work, EWC and Piggyback, to experiment on the \textit{CLVision Challenge} issued by CVPR 2020 Workshop. \textcolor{red}{[PlaceHolder for EWC]}. For Piggyback, the initial performance is far worse even than baseline, then we propose a combination of EWC and Piggyback, which led to the best performance in our project in both NI and NC cases. In the future, we could try out and continue to use and refine some dynamical approaches like DEN, and other incremental approaches\cite{zhou2012online}.
